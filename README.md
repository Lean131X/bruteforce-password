# Brute Force Password Cracker

This project implements a simple **controlled brute force** algorithm in Python to understand how password guessing attacks work and to reflect on the importance of using secure passwords.

---

## How to run the program

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lean131X/bruteforce-password.git
   cd bruteforce-password
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
   Check with:
   ```bash
   python --version
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python bruteforce.py
Example output
   If the secret password is "yaQ@", the output could be:
   ```yaml
   Password found: yaQ@
   Attempts made: 9339544
   Time taken: 0.5667 seconds
   (The number of attempts and time may vary depending on your computerâ€™s speed.)
```
Reflection

Execution time grows significantly when the password is longer or when the alphabet includes more characters (uppercase, numbers, symbols).

Short passwords like "abc" can be found in milliseconds.

A password with 8+ characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols generates billions of possible combinations, making brute force attacks impractical.

This demonstrates the importance of using long, unique, and secure passwords.
