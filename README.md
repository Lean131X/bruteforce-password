# Brute Force Password Cracker

This project implements a simple **controlled brute force** algorithm in Python to understand how password guessing attacks work and to reflect on the importance of using secure passwords.

## 🚀 How to run the program

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lean131X/bruteforce-password.git
   cd bruteforce-password
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Check with:

bash
Copiar código
python --version
Run the script:

bash
Copiar código
python bruteforce.py
📌 Example output
If the secret password is "yaq@", the output could be:

yaml
Copiar código
Password found: yaq@
Attempts made: 9393544
Time taken: 0.5667 seconds
(The number of attempts and time may vary depending on your computer’s speed.)

🔎 Reflection
Execution time grows significantly when the password is longer or when the alphabet includes more characters (uppercase, numbers, symbols).

Short passwords like "abc" can be found in milliseconds.

A password with 8+ characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols generates billions of possible combinations, making brute force attacks impractical.

👉 This demonstrates the importance of using long, unique, and secure passwords.
